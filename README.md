# TechDegreeProject-1

This project is my introductory project in Team Treehouse's Tech Degree Program. It introduced me to the JavaScript fundamentals including the array as a data structure, object literals and functions.

### What does it do?

This project randomly selects a quote from an array of quote objects using the Math.random() method and displays it on screen. The quote will update every 30 seconds, or when the "show another quote" button is clicked. The background color is also randomly generated and updates with each quote.
